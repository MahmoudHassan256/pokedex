<h1>Pokedex</h1>

<p><strong>Organization:</strong> Skills Academy Ltd.</p>

<p><strong>Location:</strong> 1 Har Sinai St., Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>The Pokedex project is a web application designed to interface with the PokeAPI to retrieve information about the first 20 Pokémon and display them to users in the form of cards on the main page. Users can click on a specific Pokémon card to view additional details on an inner page. Additionally, there is a "Load More" button at the bottom of the main page to fetch the next 20 Pokémon, implementing pagination functionality.</p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>React:</strong> The project is implemented using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</li>
  <li><strong>CSS:</strong> All styling is done using CSS without relying on any component libraries.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Task Breakdown</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Project Planning:</strong> The project is divided into three parts. In the initial phase, a project plan is created, including a component distribution diagram and an architecture plan.</li>
  <li><strong>Project Structure and Data Fetching:</strong> The project is initialized using React, and the components are structured according to the plan created in the first phase. Data is fetched from the PokeAPI to populate the components on both the main and inner pages.</li>
  <li><strong>Design:</strong> The final phase involves adding design elements to the skeleton built in the previous phase. The goal is to make the project visually similar to the original design.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Bonus Tasks</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Search Field:</strong> Implement a search field that filters Pokémon based on their names.</li>
  <li><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> Ensure that the website is responsive and works well on mobile devices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tools and Resources</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Design Link:</strong> <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/vD1GXGZdW3SKRXnSyUAhId/Pokedex?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=vMpS0os9l2TueEvS-0"></a></li>
  <li><strong>React Hooks:</strong> Utilize React Hooks for managing state and side effects.</li>
  <li><strong>Fetch Data from API with useEffect:</strong> Use the useEffect hook to fetch data from the API.</li>
